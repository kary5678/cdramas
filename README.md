# Decade Analysis of Chinese Dramas

This project seeks to understand Chinese drama productions and uncover trends in a variety of aspects, particularly addressing the following questions:

* How has the industry changed over time?
* Who are big names based on appearances in well-received works?
* Given a summary or name of a drama, can we predict its genre or give a watch recommendation?
